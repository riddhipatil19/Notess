## What is REST?

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) APIs are a way for applications to communicate with each other over the internet. They follow a set of principles that make them efficient and widely used in modern web development.

## Traditional vs REST Approach

### Traditional Approach:
- **Client Request** → **Server** → **JSP Page Response**

### REST Approach:
- **Client Request** → **Server** → **JSON Data Response**

Instead of sending a full HTML page (like JSP), REST APIs respond with data in **JSON** format.

## Why Use REST APIs?

- If we want to develop both a **web application** and a **mobile app**, the traditional approach would require **different backend implementations** for each.
- By using REST APIs, we can:
  - Develop the **frontend separately** using technologies like **React**, **Angular**, or native mobile code.
  - Create a **single, unified backend** that serves data via REST APIs.
  - Enable smooth communication between frontend and backend using **JSON**.

## Summary

Using REST APIs with Spring Boot helps in building scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications by separating concerns between frontend and backend.
