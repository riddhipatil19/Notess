## JDBC steps without Spring

- **Load the Driver:** Load the JDBC driver for the database being used. 
- **Define Connection URL:** Define the URL where the database is hosted along with credentials. 
- **Establish Connection:** Establish a connection to the database using DriverManager. 
- **Create Statement Object:** Create a Statement or PreparedStatement object to execute queries. 
- **Execute Query:** Execute the query and retrieve the result using ResultSet. 
- **Process the Result:** Process the ResultSet to fetch the required data. 
- **Close the Connection:** Close the connection, statement, and result set to avoid memory leaks.

## JDBC with Spring
The JDBC Template in Spring simplifies the process of working with databases by reducing boilerplate code. It internally handles:
- **Connection with database:**  It manages connection to the database using a DataSource.
- **Query Execution:** SQL queries can be executed directly using provided methods (queryForObject, query, update, etc.). 
- **Output Retrieval:** Retrieve results from the query in the form of objects, lists, or directly as primitive data types.

## Dependencies needed to create a Spring JDBC project:

- **JDBC API:** It provides the necessary tools to interact with the database using Spring JDBC. 
- **H2 Database:** An in-memory database that stores data during runtime but clears the data once the application is stopped.

## In-Memory Database(H2):

- Spring Boot provides built-in support for the H2 database, which is an in- memory database. 
- By default in H2, the data is stored temporarily in memory, and it is lost when the application is stopped or restarted. 
- H2 is ideal for development and testing environments where persistent storage is not required
